# Sadie Stacey-Sullivan's Web Portfolio

For this project, I used the mockups and design elements I created in the User Experience Design course, as a guideline to create my Web Portfolio Site. 
The goal of this site, is to reflect who I am and what I am capable of doing. 

## Challenges faced during development

During the development of my Web Portfolio, the biggest challenge I faced, was trying to incorporate a hamburger menu for the mobile version. 
I watched many YouTube videos to further understand the process of creating a hamburger menu but discovered that most methods utilize JavaScript,
the methods that only included HTML and CSS were very code heavy and difficult to follow. In light of this, I decided to utilize BootStrap and its
OffCanvas Navbar to create the hamburger menu. This allowed me to easily create a hamburger menu that transitions to a full sized navigation on desktop. 

Furthermore, I faced challenges utlizing BootStrap for my Web Portfolio. My knowledge of BootStrap was limited so I didn't have the confidence to use 
BootStrap for the entirety of my design. Because of this, I utilized my own style sheet to add additional CSS and create my media queries. 

### What I learned

During the development of my Web Portfolio, I practiced utlizing the skills I learnt throughout the semester and was able to develop upon them. In fact,
when I first began learning BootStrap, I was very overwhelmed by the amount of classes and their different functionalities. In spite of that, whilst creating
my portfolio, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of BootStrap and the ability to utlize their classes in my design. Additionally, I tend to become overwhelmed
whilst creating a web site with multiple pages due to the large amount of content. During this project, I was able to practice breaking down the project into smaller chunks
which allowed me to stay organized and be less overwhelmed by the process.
